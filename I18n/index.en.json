    "Audio Library-circle-help": ["Chirpity can organise your audio into a permanent library at a location of your choice, such as a data disk or network drive. Once saved, you can remove the original files, and all records will be viewable in the application. To save audio to the library, you can either go to the Records menu and choose 'Save Audio from Archive Results to Library', or enable the 'Add to Library on Save' option below. Files will be stored in the following structure: <p><code>Recording Site / Year / Month / Filename</code></p> 'Lossy' audio requires about 1GB of storage per 24 hours, while 'Lossless' converts files to FLAC format, preserving original fidelity, bitrate, and channels, but roughly halving the file size."],

    "Detections Per Segment-circle-help": ["Sets the maximum number of detections that will be shown in any 3 second period"],
    "Context Mode-circle-help": ["When enabled, context mode adapts predictions by analysing the surrounding context. It can only be changed prior to an analysis, and a low initial confidence threshold is recommended e.g 20-30%. Context mode is not available in the BirdNET model"],
    "Crop Library-circle-help": ["When enabled, audio files containing daylight periods are cropped, so the audio is only saved for nocturnal periods."],
    "Debug Mode-circle-help": ["Enter debug mode (changes to this setting require a Chirpity relaunch to take effect)"],
    "Decorators-circle-help": ["'Pad' adds 2 seconds before and after a selection to the exported audio. 'Fade' adds a 1 second fade effect to the start and end of the audio"],
    "Default Location-circle-help": ["Chirpity uses location information to determine the dawn and dusk times for recordings"],

If you set your recorder to auto-increment files after a short period of time, enabling this setting will dramatically reduce the storage required if there are long periods without activity"],
    "Signal to Noise Ratio-circle-help": ["The SNR filter, when enabled, will skip over portions of audio where any audio event is below the threshold. Higher values skip increasingly noisy segments. whilst this will result in faster processing it must be considered <b><i>experimental</i></b> and any non-zero value may miss detections. <b>Tip:</b> To find a workable SNR value, run analysis on a short file with the faintest detections you can confidently identify. Increase the SNR value until the detection is not picked up. Once you find this threshold, back it off to the highest level that picks up the detection."],
    "Species Threshold-circle-help": ["Define the minimum eBird checklist frequency for species inclusion. If 'Adjust list for the week of the year' is enabled, the list will be adjusted to include species expected for the recording week."],
    "Threads-circle-help": ["The number of parallel analyses to run. By default, this is set to the number of CPU cores on the machine for fastest performance. With the GPU backend, a lower number works better e.g. 1-3"],

    "Volume Adjustment-circle-help": ["Adjust the volume of audio to compensate for low recording levels."],
    "File-timestamp-circle-help": ["Some audio recorders, for example the Zoom H1 Essential, can set the file saved date and time to the beginning of the recording, rather than the end. If you have such a recorder selecting this option will fix the times shown for your detections (changes to this setting require a Chirpity relaunch to take effect)"],
