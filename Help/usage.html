        <li>Open an audio file, files or folder of audio. There are a three ways to do this:
            <ol>
                
                <li>Drag and drop the files or folders onto the Chirpity Nocmig application</li><li>In the Chirpity Nocmig application, select File &gt; Open Audio File or press Ctrl-O and select the
                    files to open</li>
                <li>Right-click on the audio file(s) in Windows Explorer (or Finder on a Mac) and select "Open with" &gt; Chirpity</li>
            </ol>
            Ideally, files will be those recorded by your digital recorder with their original
            timestamp. In this case, you will be able to take advantage of the <b>Time of Day</b> mode for the
            spectrogram timeline, which will show the actual time calls were
            detected. If not, you can still display (and store) the correct time of day for the file and detections if
            you edit its start time.
            This can be edited by right-clicking the filename in the control bar.

        </li>
        <li>
            Select &quot;<i>Analyse file</i>&quot; from the
            <b>Analysis</b> menu. Depending on the file length, this may take several minutes. A progress indicator will
            appear as a guide to how long this is likely to take. To stop the analysis at any point, press the
            <b>Esc</b>
            key.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class="pt-2">Exploring Detections</h5>

    <ol start="4">
        <li>
            As the model makes detections, they appear in a table below the spectrogram. Clicking the detection's row in
            the table will cause the playhead to jump to the start of that detection and highlight its location on the
            spectrogram.
            Right-clicking the row will bring up the detection context menu.
            <figure class="figure float-end m-3">
                <img src="Help/detection menu.png"
                    alt="The context menu accessed from a detection contains options to inspect and amend the record"
                    class="rounded figure-img float-end img-fluid">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-muted text-end">Detection context menu.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            This contains options specific to the currently highlighted detection.
            You may press the SpaceBar to play from the beginning of the selection and continue playing the
            audio until you press the SpaceBar again. Clicking the spectrogram will move the playhead to that position.
            If currently playing, playback will continue, so this allows you to replay a call repeatedly.
        </li>
        <li>
            If multiple detections apply for a given time period, a circle will be displayed next to the Species' name.
            Clicking this circle will display the other species detected in the region, and the confidence given to
            those IDs.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class="pt-2">Summary and Filtering Detections</h5>
    <ol start="6">
        <li>
            A summary table appears to the left of the results once the model has completed its analysis. Importantly,
            this table allows you to filter the results displayed in the main results
            table. Click the species name in the summary to limit
            the display to that single species. This is <i>extremely</i> useful if several hundred Robin calls were
            detected!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class="pt-2">Custom "Deep Dive" Detections</h5>
    <ol start="7">
        <li>Sometimes, a call is missed or a detection is erroneous due to the position of the analysis window in
            relation
            to the call. The window can be moved by dragging it, or you can create a new window by clicking and
            dragging out a custom region on the spectrogram. Once you have a new region, select
            <span class="material-symbols-outlined">search</span> <b>Analyse</b> from the context menu or <b>Analysis &gt;
                Analyse
                selected interval</b> from the menu.
            The detections for the selected region appear in an overlay window and can be saved to the results or
            discarded.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5 class="pt-2">Amending Results</h5>
    <ol start="8">
        <li>It is possible to remove results by selecting <span
                class="delete material-symbols-outlined">delete_forever</span> <b>Delete Record</b> in the context menu.
            This can be selected on a per-detection basis in the results table, or a per-species basis in the summary.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h5 class="pt-2">Saving Results</h5>
    <ol start="9">
                <li><p><b>N.B.</b> Results are not saved by default.</p>Save results by selecting <b>Records &gt; <span class="material-symbols-outlined">archive</span> Save to Archive </b>
                    
                </li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="reload" class="pt-2">Restoring Results</h5>
    <p>When you save your detections in Chirpity, a database is updated with the details of the detections. If
        you
        reload your file at a later date, and select analyse file, the saved results are restored. <b>N.B.</b> If the
        original file is missing because it has
        since been compressed to one of the supported formats ('.mp3', '.wav', '.mpga', '.ogg', '.opus', '.flac',
        '.aac'), so long as it
        retains the same name, but with a new extension, Chirpity will find and load that file instead and, rather than
        take its
        cue from this file's creation time, use the original one.</p>
    <p>From the records menu, you can also browse saved detections by species, and within a date range of your choosing.
        Furthermore, you can generate charts of the species detected over time.</p>

    <h5 id="export" class="pt-2">Exporting Results</h5>
    There are a number of ways to export detections.
    <ol>
        <li>
            Export an audio clip of a detection. To do this, select <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                music_note
            </span><b>Export Audio Clip</b> on the context menu. By default, the filename will contain the
            species and
            timestamp of the detection identifying its position in the original audio file. The <b>Settings</b>
            menu allows you
            to control the format and quality of the exported files as well as apply padding and a fade effect
            to the beginning and end of the audio.
        </li>
        <li>
            Export a CSV file of detections. To do this, select <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                ios_share
            </span><b>Export results to CSV</b> from the file menu. This will export the results to a CSV file in the folder you choose.
        </li>
        <li>Save the detections as a label file in Audacity format. Press <b>Ctrl-A</b> or select <b>File &gt; Save
            Audacity Labels</b> from the menu. By default, the label file will have the same name as the
            audio file,with a ".txt" extension.
        </li>
    </ol>
