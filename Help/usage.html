<h4 class="text-center">Suggested Workflow</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Open an audio file. Ideally, this will be the file that was recorded by your digital recorder with its original
        timestamp. By using this file, you will be able to take advantage of the <b>Options > Spectrogram >
            Timeline >
            Time of Day</b> mode for the spectrogram timeline, which will show the actual time calls were detected.
        <b>N.B.</b>
        It is possible to cancel a file load operation by pressing the <b>Esc</b> key.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the file has loaded, select &quot;<i>Analyse entire file</i>&quot; from the <b>Analysis</b> menu. Depending
        on the file length, this may take several minutes. A progress indicator will appear to guide you on how long
        this is likely to take. To stop the analysis, press the <b>Esc</b> key.
    </li>
</ol>
<h5 class="pt-2">Exploring Detections</h5>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        As the model makes detections, they appear in a table below the spectrogram. Clicking the detection's row in
        the table will cause the playhead to jump to the start of that detection. Press <b>P</b>, or the
        <span class='material-icons play pointer align-bottom'>play_circle_filled</span> icon to play the detection.
        Alternatively, you may press the SpaceBar to play from the beginning of the selection and continue playing the
        audio until you press the SpaceBar again. Clicking the spectrogram will move the playhead to that position.
        Playback will continue, so this allows you to replay a call repeatedly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Selecting the <img src="img/logo/XC.png" alt="XC"> icon will open a search result (in your default web broswer)
        for the
        detected species' night flight calls on the Xeno Canto website. Here you can compare the result to Nocmig
        recordings
        uploaded by others.
    </li>
    <li>
        If multiple species were detected, or if the detection has an alternative ID for the call, a
        <span class='material-icons-two-tone'>expand_more</span> icon will be displayed in the Other IDs
        table column. Clicking this will open rows beneath with the details of those species.
    </li>
</ol>
<h5 class="pt-2">Summary and Filtering Detections</h5>
<ol start="6">
    <li>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-toggle="modal">
            Show Summary
        </button>
        appears once the model has completed its analysis. Clicking the button will open a summary table of the
        detections across the file. Importantly, this table allows you to filter the results displayed in the main
        results
        table. Click the filter icon ( <span class="material-icons-two-tone align-bottom  ">filter_alt</span> ) to limit
        the
        display to that single species, or the <span class="material-icons-two-tone align-bottom ">clear</span> icon to
        exclude a species from the result table. This is <i>extremely</i> useful if several hundred Robin calls were
        detected!
    </li>
</ol>
<h5 class="pt-2">Custom "Deep Dive" Detections</h5>
<ol start="7">
    <li>Sometimes, a call is missed or a detection is erroneous due to the position of the analysis window in relation
        to the call. The window can be moved by dragging it, or you can create a new window by clicking and
        dragging out a custom region on the spectrogram. Once you have a new region, select <b>Analysis > Analyse
            selected interval</b> from the menu. The custom detection is placed at the top of the results table.
        <b>N.B.</b> The detection threshold is much reduced for custom detections, so exercise appropriate caution since
        false positives are more likely. Uncoloured confidence icons should be treated as a "wild guess", even
        considered by the model more likely to be wrong than right.
    </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="pt-2">Saving Results</h5>
<ol start="8">
    <li>Currently, there are three ways to save results:
        <ul>
            <li>Save the detections as a label file in Audacity format. Press <b>Ctrl-S</b> or select <b>File > Save
                Audacity Labels</b> from the menu. By default, the label file will have the same name as the audio file,
                with a ".txt" extension.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save a 3-second audio clip of a detection (in MP3 format). To do this, click the <span
                    class='material-icons-outlined align-bottom'>
            file_download</span> icon in the result table. By default, the filename will contain the species and
                timestamp of the detection identifying its position in the original audio file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save a custom MP3 clip. Select a region of the spectrogram by dragging the mouse over the area of audio
                you
                want
                to save.
                From the File menu, select <b>Export Selected Audio</b> to bring up a file save dialog.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h5 class="pt-2">Feedback</h5>
<ol start="9">
    <li>
        <p>Machine Learning requires vast amounts of data. Adequate results can be obtained from a few hundred examples
            of a
            call, but for robust and reliable results several thousand examples are needed. Those examples need to be
            representative of the
            range of vocalisations a bird can make, under a wide range of conditions.
            Providing feedback is the best way to help improve the quality of detections and takes as few as two clicks
            of a
            mouse.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you think a detection is correct, click the <span
                    class='material-icons-two-tone text-success align-bottom'>
             thumb_up_alt</span> icon and confirm to submit the feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you think the prediction is incorrect, click the <span
                    class='material-icons-two-tone text-danger align-bottom'>
             thumb_down_alt</span> icon. This will bring up a prompt inviting you to say what you think the prediction
                should have been. The list can be filtered by entering the first few letters of the species in the box.
                Selecting the species will check the ID, and hitting send will submit the feedback.
            </li>
            <li>In either case, hitting <b>Esc</b> will cancel the submission.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
