<h6>The Chirpity Vision, and a Note on Accuracy</h6>
<p>
    Chirpity Nocmig works by detecting calls found in 3-second audio windows. Actually, it detects <i>images</i> of
    calls generated from audio files. Behind the scenes it takes audio, converts and resamples it from the source format
    and creates a
    spectrogram for each audio sample. It performs 1200 predictions per hour. By one measure - number of predictions /
    number correct - it often achieves around 99% accuracy. However, that figure will not reflect the experience of
    using the software in the real world. The fact is, most of us are not interested to know that thousands of "no call"
    predictions were correct, it's the quality of species detections that matter.
</p>
<p>
    The reality is that this prototype can still easily be thrown off by novel sounds, sounds it has not seen enough of
    during its training. A new car alarm sound can trigger dozens of false IDs. Wind in trees, pops and bangs, people
    playing football a quarter of a mile away - all these noises can appear similar to a bird call.
</p>
<p>
    Generally though, it is not difficult to breeze past these shortcomings with a little practice. You learn that
    people and dogs may be confused with geese and swans, that a car alarm can be confused with a wader. As the dawn
    chorus approaches and the density of bird vocalizations increases the chance that it may mistake a snatch of robin
    sub-song for a skylark.
</p>
<p>
    The value of Chirpity Nocmig lies in its ability to <i>simplify and support</i> the process of identifying birds by
    sound. It is
    sufficiently accurate, even now, to be a useful tool. It's a long way from beating Kasparov at Chess, but for anyone
    struggling to get a handle on bird identification by sound, this software will help enormously.
</p>
<p>
    Over time, the software will improve. As the model is exposed to a greater variety of noise data, it will learn
    to ignore more of those noises, and the false positives will diminish. Refinements to the deep learning architecture
    will also bring improvements - future updates may incorporate location and date information to refine predictions,
    for example.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't expect perfection, you won't be disappointed.
