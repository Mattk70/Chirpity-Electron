        <td><b>How does Chirpity organise my detections</b></td>
        <td>
            <p>The application creates a checklist for each file associated with your export. These checklists contain a total of the call detections for each species in that file.
            Where you have entered a call count, this figure is used, otherwise one call is assumed.</p>
            <p>The exported file contains a row of headers explaining what each column represents. 
                You'll find <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000907878-upload-spreadsheet-data-to-ebird#anchorRecordFormat" target="_blank">further details</a> 
                on the eBird site.
            </p>
            <p><b>Important:</b> the header row needs to be deleted before you upload the file.</p>

        <td><b>How do I upload my eBird record file?</b></td>
        <td>
            Visit <a href="https://www.ebird.org/home" target="_blank">eBird</a> and sign up for or sign in to your eBird account. Once you have an account
            and are logged in go to <a href="https://ebird.org/import/upload.form?theme=ebird" target="_blank">the import form</a>.
            <ol>
                <li>Click "Choose file" and select the file you have prepared</li>
                <li><b>Important:</b> check &quot;eBird Record format (Extended)&quot;</li>
                <li>Hit &quot;Import file&quot;</li>
            </ol>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Why are there errors when I try to upload my record file?</b></td>
        <td>
            <p>Firstly, make sure you have deleted the header row. eBird expects the first row in the file to contain an observation.</p>
            <p>If this is not the problem, and you are seeing errors relating to species not being recognised, make sure the language preferences you have set in Chirpity 
                match those you have set for your eBird account.</p> 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Why are Country and State/Province columns blank?</b></td>
        <td>
            <p>These fields are optional in the eBird record format. Although the OpensStreetMap place lookup API used by Chirpity will give State and Country, it does not supply them in the 
                format used by eBird. You can look up the correct format for your country and region in this <a href="https://support.ebird.org/helpdesk/attachments/48293281603" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Why did you choose eBird? Do you have plans to allow sharing with other sites?</b></td>
        <td>
            <p>eBird is the simplest platform to use. This is because it has a published record format, and perhaps most importantly, the eBird taxonomy aligns to the one
            used by the both the BirdNET and Nocmig models.</p>
            <p>I hope to offer the ability to share audio clips with Xeno-Canto in a future release. This depends on them releasing a suitable upload API.</p>
