        <td><b>Use whitelist</b></td>
        <td>Enabled by default. This option limits the species detections shown to those recorded at UK Nocmig sites
            submitting data to Trektellen.
            <p>If disabled, the full list of potential detections is used. This includes
                UK vagrants as well as those birds not known to call or fly at night. Non-bird detections will also
                appear. </p>
            This full list comprises 306 bird species and the following non-bird classes:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ambient noise:</b> wind, rain, pops and bangs. Things that go bump in the night...</li>
                <li><b>Animals:</b> cats, dogs, bats, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Human:</b> voices, whistles, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Vehicles:</b> Wheel and engine noise of cars, trucks, trains and aircraft. Also sirens and alarms
                    (including domestic burglar alarms) and horns.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you wish to see the full list of species Chirpity <i>Nocmig</i> was trained on, it is contained in the
                feedback prompt offered when giving feedback on an incorrect prediction.</p>
            Disabling the whitelist is <em>not</em> recommended for general use. It will lead to an increase in false
            positive detections, and clutter the results table with irrelevant detections.

            of significantly reduced functionality. However, results will be displayed and a label file may be exported
            for use in Audacity.

                    <b>Time Elapsed</b> displays the time from the beginning of the file.

                <li>
                    <b>Time of Day</b> uses the file timestamp to
                    calculate the actual time of the calls detected. If a file does not have a timestamp reflecting the
                    time of the recording, this will give a spurious reading.
