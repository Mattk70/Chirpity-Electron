        <td>This setting determines the minimum confidence level required for the model to report a detection.
            Increasing the value reduces false positives but increases the risk of missing genuine calls.
            A value around 50% provides a good balance between detecting genuine calls and minimizing false positives.

        <td><p><b>Migrants and Owls</b>. Just report detections relating to these species' calls (song detections are
            excluded).</p>
            <p><b>All birds</b>. Include birdsong as well as calls, also includes species not known to call at night.
            </p>
            <p><b>Everything</b>. This full list comprises 305 bird species and the following non-bird classes:</p>

        <th>Nocmig Mode</th>
        <td>
            Only search for detections at night. Chirpity calculates the end and start of civil twilight for the dates
            of the files and the location that is set.

    <tr>
        <th>Context Mode</th>
        <td> In this mode, Chirpity will use the surrounding context when making predictions. This helps mitigate
            against false positive detections.

    <tr>
        <th>Timeline</th>
        <td>The spectrogram timeline has two modes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Timecode</b> displays the time elapsed from the beginning of the file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Time of Day</b> relies on file timestamps to determine the actual time of detected calls.
                    If a file's timestamp does not reflect the recording time, an inaccurate reading will result.
                    To edit the start time of the current file,
                    select the desired date and time using the <span

                    <b>CPU</b> will use the CPU for predictions, this is generally faster if you have an integrated
                    graphics card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>GPU</b> will use the graphics card. If you have a dedicated graphics card, this will typically be
                    significantly faster.

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Threads</th>
        <td>This setting allows you to select the number of threads to use for predictions.
            When using the CPU backend, the number of threads is automatically set to match the number of CPU cores available on the computer.
            By default, the GPU backend uses one thread. Adjusting this setting, along with the batch size, can optimize the speed of predictions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Batch Size</th>
        <td>This setting determines the number of three-second audio chunks to process each time a prediction is requested.
            Larger values lead to faster processing, especially on long files.
            However, setting it too high for your machine can cause the Chirpity model to crash due to memory limitations.
            If this happens, set a lower value and restart Chirpity.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Signal to Noise threshold</th>
        <td>This setting is exclusive to the CPU backend. When enabled, Chirpity will disregard audio sections with unclear signals.
            The strength of the signal required for a prediction to be attempted increases with a higher signal-to-noise value.
            This results in significant speed gains, but may cause Chirpity to miss quieter, more distant calls.
