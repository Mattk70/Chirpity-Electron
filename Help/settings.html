        <th>Set Threshold</th>
        <td>Sets the confidence above which the model will report a detection. Higher values will reduce false
            positives, although that will increase the risk of missing genuine calls. A figure around 50% gives a good
            balance (i.e. it will detect most genuine calls while minimising false positive detections).

                <li><b>Efficient:</b> New model. Faster, less memory intensive and more sensitive. More prone to false IDs when there is a lot of background noise.</li>

            <p><b>All birds</b>. Include birdsong as well as calls, also includes species not known to call at night.</p>
            <p><b>Everything</b>. This full list comprises 305 bird species and the following non-bird classes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ambient noise:</b> wind, rain, pops and bangs. Things that go bump in the night...</li>
                <li><b>Animals:</b> cats, dogs, bats, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Human:</b> voices, whistles, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Vehicles:</b> Wheel and engine noise of cars, trucks, trains and aircraft. Also sirens and alarms
                    (including domestic burglar alarms) and horns.

        <th>Batch Size</th>
        <td>Sets the number of three second chunks of audio to pass to the model each time a prediction is requested.
            A higher number will make processing up to three times faster on long files.
            If set too high for your machine, the Chirpity model may crash as it runs out of memory. In that event, set
            a lower value, close and restart Chirpity.

                    <b>Time Elapsed</b> displays the time from the beginning of the file.

                    <b>Time of Day</b> uses files timestamps to
                    calculate the actual time of the calls detected. If a file does not have a timestamp reflecting the
                    time of the recording, this will give a spurious reading. The start time of the current file can be
                    edited by selecting the appropriate date and time on the <span
