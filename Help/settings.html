            positives, at the expense of missing genuine calls.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Ambient noise:</b> wind, rain, pops and bangs. Things that go bump in the night...</li>

                <li><b>Human:</b> voices, whistles, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Vehicles:</b> Wheel and engine noise of cars, trucks, trains and aircraft. Also sirens and alarms
                    (including domestic burglar alarms) and horns.

    <tr>
        <th>Batch Size</th>
        <td>Sets the number of predictions to pass to the model each time. A higher number will make predictions up to
            3x faster on long files.
            If set too high for your machine, the Chirpity model will crash as it runs out of memory. In that event, set
            a lower value, close and restart Chirpity.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Warm Up</th>
        <td>Because of the way the model works, the first prediction it is asked to do after Chirpity is opened will
            take much longer to process.
            When "Warm up" is checked, the model is passed a dummy prediction as soon as it is loaded. This happens in
            the background.

                    <b>Time of Day</b> uses the file timestamp to
                    calculate the actual time of the calls detected. If a file does not have a timestamp reflecting the
                    time of the recording, this will give a spurious reading. The start time of the current file can be
                    edited
                    by selecting the appropriate date and time on the <span
