<h4>Have you hit on a problem, or perhaps you have a suggestion?</h4>

If you have, then I'd be happy to hear about it. I keep track of issues and suggestions on Github. 

<p>Take a look at what others have been reporting, if you think you have a similar problem or suggestion, add a comment to the thread.</p>

<p> If, on the other hand, you think you've got something new, go on and report an <a href="https://github.com/Mattk70/Chirpity-Electron/issues" target="_blank">issue</a> or start a <a href="https://github.com/Mattk70/Chirpity-Electron/discussions/" target="_blank">discussion</a> - I'll get back to you as soon as I can. </p>
I can't promise I'll make everything right, but I probably won't fix what I don't know about &#x00AF;\\_(ãƒ„)_/&#x00AF;<p>Meanwhile, I hope you find Chirpity useful, and happy birding!</p>
